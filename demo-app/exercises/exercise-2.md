# Exercise 2

1. Add a new button to each list item with a label of "Edit".

2. When the "Edit" button is clicked, display two input fields for the name and hexcode of the color in the list item.

3. When the input fields are displayed, the "Edit" and "Archive" buttons should not be shown. Instead, display two buttons "Save" and "Cancel". The save button saves the changes, the cancel button cancels the changes.

4. After saving or canceling, remove the input controls.

5. Ensure it works!
