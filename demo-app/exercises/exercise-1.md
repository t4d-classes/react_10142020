# Exercise 1.

1. In the Color Tool application, add a button to each item in the list. The button should have the label "Archive".

2. When the archive button is clicked, the color should disappear from the list, but should still be in the array colors.

3. Add a check box to top of the list with a label of "Show Archived". When the button is clicked, show the archived items in a slightly lighter font color in the list along with the non-archived items.

4. Ensure it works!
