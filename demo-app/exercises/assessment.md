# Assessment

Implement the code below with both class-based and functional (with hooks) components. 

1. Using the "create-react-app" tool, create a new React application named "color-tool".

2. The "color-tool" application should provide the following features:

- Display a header with the following text "My Favorite Colors".
- Below the header, display a list of colors, each color list item should display a name and hexcode.
- Below the list of colors, display a form with two fields: name and hexcode. Provide a button such that when the button is clicked, the data entered into the fields is added to the list of colors, and the fields are cleared.

3. The header, list of colors and form should not be in the same component. But all three can be called from the same parent component.

4. Ensure it works!
